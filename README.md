# Full-Stack Web Programming Challenge

---

*Create a live-updating tree view as a web application*

- [ ]  All users should see any changes made to the tree immediately across browsers without refreshing or polling.
- [ ]  State of the tree should remain persistent; reloading should not undo any state.
- [ ]  All of a factory's existing child nodes should be removed upon each new generation
- [ ]  Project should be secure, validate inputs, and protect against injections
- [ ]  project should be hosted on web using AWS or Heroku to run your submission
- [ ]  Use a database on backend

---

- [ ]  Tree contain group on nodes, with a main (root) node that can have any number of 'factories'
- [ ]  factory nodes can in turn generate a set amount of random numbers (up to 15), represented as child nodes of their respective factories
- [ ]  Factories and children should be created through some means of user input (right click, button press, etc) specifying the number of children to generate (up to 15) and the ranges of those children.
- [ ]  Factories should have an adjustable name assigned to them, be removable, and have an adjustable lower and upper bound for the random number generation
- [ ]  may use any programming languages and front-end design styles of your choosing
